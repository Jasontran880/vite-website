# First React Website

First custom website built with React + Vite + TailwindCSS.
Starting from zero experience in web development, I learned the barebone basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript in the Odin Project and jumped straight into a React project.

I followed several youtube videos for the structure of my project, for some styling, and for instruction on how to import custom components from AceternityUI.
I employed the use of several AI models to help with debugging and implementing my ideas, though I did not employ the agent feature as I found that robbed me of learning 
and messed up my code structure.

From this experience I learned about the structure of HTML files, the structure of a React Project within Vite, creating react components, mounting components within eachother, importing custom components,
html styling in Tailwind.
